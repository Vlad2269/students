##Guide to online learning tools and technologies

The following is a list of online learning tools and technologies that you may be required to use. Note that due to the extremely short timelines under which
your instructors have had to transition to an online teaching model, they are each having to choose the set of tools for their courses. This means that you
will see a variety of tools and approaches across your courses.

More common technologies
------------------------

### Hardware

-   at a bare minimum, you need a working microphone connected to your computer

-   a webcam is highly recommended, although it is possible to get by without
    one

### VPN

-   makes your computer behave as if it were connected to the Internet from
    within the University of Waterloo

-   use this to access N drive

-   use this to access EngLab

-   use this to bypass certain firewalls

### EngLab

-   login virtually to a computer within an Engineering Computing computer on
    campus (e.g. Wedge Lab, Fulcrum Lab, Pulley Lab, etc.)

-   need a Remote Desktop client app

-   need to connect through UW VPN first

-   go to https://englab.uwaterloo.ca

### Learn

-   the same Learn you've come to know and love

### Webex

-   web conferencing system for live presentations/lectures/tutorials/help
    sessions

-   uses \@uwaterloo.ca account for authentication

    -   since students were moved from \@edu.uwaterloo.ca to \@uwaterloo.ca at
        the end of April, this system should still be considered 'beta' for
        students

### Piazza
